The main goal of this project is to provide us with the opportunity to learn.
And while every project, commercial or not, can be seen as a learning 
opportunity, we want to bring this to a bit higher level. We want
to structure our learning by listing technologies, ideas, methodologies and
concepts that we want to try out, practice and master throughout this project.


There are two main areas in which we want to improve.

##1. Development process. 
More often than not, we jump into developing projects so we can have a 
piece in our portfolio, showcase our skills and what we have built. We 
tend to code now, think about the big picture later. Fix issues as we go, 
not plan and think how to avoid the issues in the first place. 
With this project we want to reverse that tendency. We want to learn how to 
prepare a proper documentation, use version control system, incorporate some 
working methodologies into our workflow, get familiar with code reviews etc. 
We want to reduce the amount of coding by carefully planning our app and 
preemptively avoiding bugs. In this area we also include cooperation skills - 
communication, division of labour, resolving potential conflicts.

##2. JavaScript skills. 
We have chosen a tech stack that is much more inlinewith what is usually used 
in production of a large scale web applications. During this project we will 
have an opportunity to work with ReactJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SASS, 
Materialize and others. At the same time, the content of our quizzes will 
require us to review all of the "You Don't Know JavaScript" series, 
thus strengthening our JS foundations.

Learning is our primary goal, more important the the app itself. That being
said delivering a complete product is the apogee of the development process
and thus is a vital part of the whole learning endavour.
