#What is YouKnowJS?

YouKnowJS is an app that provides a quiz for each
YDKJS book, so the content of each quiz is defined by the relevant book. 

Each question will come with detailed explanation of the correct answer, 
so taking the test should not be about points, it should be learning experience 
for both the test takers and the test makers.

#Target audience

This app will be useful to people who are learning JavaScript and would like an
opportunity to test their understanding of the language. More specifically, FCC users 
and people who study one of the P1xt's guides. However, the app should be easily
extensible by adding more quizzes based on other web-dev resources.
